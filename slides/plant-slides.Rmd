# Background

### Plants are threatened by many factors

- Climate change
- Habit loss
- Human disturbance
- Natural Disasters

--

### Factors that make certain species more resiliant

- Physiological traits/ Efficient metabolic processes
- Associations with symbiotic organisms

--

### Endangered and Threatened Species

- 764 plant species protected under the Endangered Species Act
- 18,291 listed as having a decreasing population by The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)

---
# Question:

## Can we predict if a plant species will have a decreasing population trend based on its photosynthetic rate and if it is threatened by climate change or human activity?

---

# Analysis Plan

### Logistic Regression

##### $$\operatorname{logit}(p)=\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1  (Photosynthetic Rate) + \beta_2  (Climate) + \beta_3  (Human) +\varepsilon $$

### Odds Ratio

##### $$\operatorname{odds}(\hat{p})=\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}=\exp \left(\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 \cdot Photosynthetic Rate\right)$$

### Make Predictions?

```{r}
threat_prob <- function(b0, b1, b2, b3, photo, climate, human) {
  equation <- b0 + b1 * photo + b2 * climate + b3 * human
  prob <- (exp(equation)) / (1 + exp(equation))
  print(prob)
}
```

---
# Data

### Photosynthetic Rate
- `BIEN` package in R
  - Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) was developed by collaborating ecologists at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)

### Population Trend and Threats
  - IUCN Red List
    - Kingdom *Plantae*
  - Used search filters to select species threatened by climate or human activity

# Odds Ratio

### By how much does the model predict that the odds of having a decreasing population will change with each additional unit in photosynthetic rate?

$$\operatorname{odds}(\hat{p})=\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}=\exp \left(\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 \cdot Photosynthetic Rate\right)$$

```{r}
exp(mod_photo$coefficients[2])

The model estimates that one additional unit in photosynthetic rate is associated with a change in the odds ratio of $e^{-0.089} = 0.915$ or a 8.9% decrease in the odds of having a decreasing population.

# Logistic Model

## **Based on this model:**

### - Plants threatened by climate factors have their odds of having a decreasing population increase by a factor of 4.29.
### - Plants threatened by human factors have their odds increase by a factor of 2.52.
### - The odds of having a decreasing population trend fall by about 10% for each unit increase in photosynthetic rate.

---
# Limitations and Next Steps

### - IUCN and BIEN do not have all plant species and the sample here might not be representative
### - Many species on the IUCN database have an unknown population trend status
### - Apply model to species with an unknown population status

threat_prob <- function(b0, b1, b2, b3, photo, climate, human) {
  equation <- b0 + b1 * photo + b2 * climate + b3 * human
  prob <- (exp(equation)) / (1 + exp(equation))
  print(prob)
